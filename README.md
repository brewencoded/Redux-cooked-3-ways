# Redux Cooked 3 Ways
A gentle introduction to redux with minimal dependencies.

### About
This repository is a from scratch reimplementation of the Redux state management pattern.
The main goal is to show all of the Functional Programming techniques beneath the surface of the library. While I have used Redux many times before, I did did my best not to copy/paste code from the repository. This is my own implementation based on the functional programming techniques I have observed in the repository and guide. This is a naive implementation that attempts to highlight the most basic methods of recreating it's functionality.

### Getting Started
Jump into any of the sub directories and follow allong with the README. These markdown files will guide you through the code and the thought processes that went into them.
