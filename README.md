# Redux Cooked 3 Ways
A gentle introduction to redux with minimal dependencies.

### About
This repository is a from scratch reimplementation of the Redux state management pattern.
The main goal is to show all of the Functional Programming techniques beneath the surface of the library. It is important to remeber that I did not look into any of the redux codebase. This is my own implementation based on functional programming techniques in an attempt to get as close to feature Parity as possible, while also keeping implementation as similar as possible.

### Getting Started
Jump into any of the sub directories and follow allong with the README. These markdown files will guide you through the code and the thought processes that went into them.
